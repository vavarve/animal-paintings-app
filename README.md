# AnimalPaintings

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.3.

## Overview

This is an Angular-based e-commerce application that showcases animal paintings as products. Users can browse the collection, add paintings to their shopping cart, and view the items in the cart. The application uses Angular Material for a responsive and visually appealing design, and Mockoon to simulate HTTP requests and responses without the need for a real backend.
